				<p>CTA</p>

		   <h3 id="ABOUT_CTA">About CTA</h3>

			   <p>CTA is another Windows environment variables editor.</p>

				<p>The editor provided by Microsoft, sysdm.cpl is really minimalist. It is not
				    user friendly and does not do its job properly
				    (see Windows environment variable problem section).
				</p>

			    <p>I searched for alternatives and found these editors:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://silvermace.com/weve/">http://silvermace.com/weve</a></li>
				   <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/yawee/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/yawee</a></li>
				   <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/winenvedit/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/winenvedit</a></li>
				   <li><a href="http://www.rapidee.com/">http://www.rapidee.com</a></li>
				</ul>

	    		<p>None of them solves the problem.</p>

			<h3 id="WINDOWS_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_PROBLEM">Windows environment variable problem</h3>

				<p>Once, I tried to build ACE/TAO/CIAO (http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/) in Windows.</p>

			   <p>I built ACE and TAO successfully but failed with CIAO.</p>

			   <p>To build ACE/TAO/CIAO, we can define environment variables ACE_ROOT,
			    TAO_ROOT and CIAO_ROOT.</p>

			   <p>TAO_ROOT is defined as ACE_ROOT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%ACE_ROOT%\TAO<br><br>
			    CIAO_ROOT is defined as TAO_ROOT: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%TAO_ROOT%\CIAO.</p>

			   <p>The problem is that Windows does not expand environment variables properly
			    when level of nested environment variables exceeds two.</p>

			   <p>In this case, Windows can resolve TAO_ROOT because it depends on ACE_ROOT
			    only. Windows is unable to resolve CIAO_ROOT because it depends on TAO_ROOT
			    that in turns depends on ACE_ROOT.</p>

			   <p>Then, to be able to build CIAO, I had to define CIAO_ROOT as its actual
			    path (or I could have defined it as %ACE_ROOT%\TAO\CIAO), that is
			    not really convenient.</p>

			   <p>CTA solves this problem.</p>

			<h3 id="NAME">Name</h3>

				<p>The name CTA comes from environment
				variables that originally highlighted the problem for me.
				</p>

				<p>The letters CTA represent:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>C: CIAO</li>
				  	<li>T: TAO</li>
				  	<li>A: ACE</li>
				</ul>

			<h3 id="LOGO">Logo</h3>
            <img src="cta.png" width="7%" height="7%"/>
				<p>The logo is composed of three circles.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The inner one corresponds to ACE</li>
					<li>The one in the middle corresponds to TAO. TAO is defined as ACE.</li>
					<li>The outer one corresponds to CIAO. CIAO is defined as TAO.</li>
					<li>Letters have been dropped for esthetic reasons.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3 id="MOTIVATION">Motivation</h3>

				<p>As I said earlier, I experienced some problems with environment variables
				when building ACE/TAO/CIAO on Windows. It was annoying but not enough to
				further investigate why.</p>

				<p>Today, I am working on a development tool for linux and windows
				operating systems that works heavily with environment variables.</p>

				<p>Since I need environment variables in Windows too, I looked for an
				explanation about this problem but didn't find anything.</p>

				<p>I decided to understand and to fix the problem...</p>

				<p>My work resulted in a Perl (Tk) application. It was my first version that
				solved the problem but was not easy to use due to a poor graphical user
				interface. The second version was a better one, still written in Perl but with wxWidgets.
				Thereafter, because I did not want users of this application having to
				install Perl and its additional packages, I decided to write a third
				version in C++. The goal was to make a self contained application with no
				external dependencies (dll), easy to install and ready to use.</p>

			<h3 id="DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT">Development environment</h3>

	    		<h4>Tools</h4>

	        		<p>I decided to make this project open source. Thus, I decided to work with
	        			open source tools only:</p>

					<ul>
	          		<li>MinGW | Minimalist GNU for Windows: http://www.mingw.org</li>

	               	<p>Minimalist development environment for native Microsoft Windows
	                		applications.</p>

	                	<p>To build CTA as C++ application (with g++).</p>

						<li>wxWidgets: http://www.wxwidgets.org</li>

	                	<p>To make CTA a graphical user interface (GUI).</p>

	      			<li>pcre: http://www.pcre.org</li>

		               <p>To use regular expressions (since I used them in the first two
		                versions with Perl, it was proper to use regular expressions in c++ too)</p>

		            <li>MPC: http://www.ociweb.com</li>

		               <p>Writing make projects for g++ can be tedious. One tool with which I
		                feel comfortable is MPC. It is a great makefile generator.</p>

		               <p>I have used version 3.9.27 included in ACE-6.0.4 but you can pick
		                the lastest version from the download site.</p>

		               <p>To generate the makefile (from src directory): mpc.pl -type make cta.mpc</p>

							<p>Makefile.cta is then generated and the only thing to do to build
	                		the application (from msys console) is: make -f Makefile.cta</p>

	            	<li>wxGlade: http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/</li>

	                	<p>To help designing graphical application (cta.wxg).</p>

							<p>Version 0.6.5</p>

	                    <p>Depedencies:</p>

	                        <ul>
	                        	<li>wxPython-2.8.12.1: http://wxpython.org</li>
	                        	<li>Python-2.7.2: http://www.python.org</li>
	                        </ul><br />

	            	<li>Inkscape: used from Ubuntu distribution.</li>

	                	<p>To sketch the logo (cta.svg).</p>

	            	<li>Gimp: http://www.gimp.org</li>

	                	<p>To convert the .svg file to .ico file (I had to run Gimp
	                		in Windows to be able to convert it with no border).</p>

		            <li>SciTE editor: http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html</li>

	                	<p>I appreciate this editor.</p>
					</ul>

	    		<h4>Implementation</h4>

					<p>I wanted CTA to be self contained, easy to use and easy to install.</p>

	        		<p>To get there, wxWidgets and pcre have been built as static libraries and
	        			standard C library has been linked statically.</p>

	        		<p>The CTA project contains prebuilt of these libraries. Steps followed to build
	        			them are presented in Install.txt file.</p>

	    		<h4>Structure</h4>

	        		<p>The content of cta directory:</p>

					<p>bin:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Executable:                         cta.exe</li>
						</ul>

	     			<p>doc:</p>

						<ul>
						<li>html documentation</li>
	            	</ul>

                    <p>pcre/pcre-8.20:</p>
	        			<ul>
	        				<li>prebuilt PCRE static library</li>
	        			</ul>

	     			<p>src:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Source files: *.h, *.cpp</li>
	            		<li>Resource files: *.rc</li>
	            		<li>Script to generate object resource: gen_icon_rc</li>
	            		<li>Object file about icon (not necessary to generate it again and again): cta_rc.o</li>
	            		<li>Project definition: cta.mpc</li>
	            		<li>Makefile: Makefile.cta</li>
	            	</ul>

	        		<p>wx:</p>

	        			<ul>
	        				<li>prebuilt wxWidgets static library</li>
	        			</ul>

			<h3 id="NOTE">Note</h3>

				<p>If you need to define environment variables according to others, this
					application is for you.</p>

				<p>If you need to define environment variables according to others, avoid
					using tools like the one provided by Windows (sysdm.cpl) because they don't
					do the job correctly. You will have to fix the problem with CTA anyway.</p>
